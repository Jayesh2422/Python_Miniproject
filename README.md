# Python_Miniproject
This project is a very basic Python-based simulation of a Champions League match between two randomly selected teams.
Some features-
Random Team Selection: After choosing a team, a random opponent is selected from the available teams.
Match Simulation: Simulates a football match where goals are scored at random intervals. The scoring team and player are chosen randomly from the selected teamâ€™s squad.
Detailed Match Output: Displays match progress in 10-minute intervals and shows the final score along with the goal scorers for both teams.
Player and Team Data: Predefined player rosters for each team
